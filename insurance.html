    <h1>Insurance and Risk Management: A Complete Guide</h1>

    <p>Insurance and risk management play a crucial role in safeguarding individuals, businesses, and assets from potential financial losses. This guide explores how both concepts work together to provide security and peace of mind while helping you make informed financial decisions.</p>

    <h2>What is Risk Management?</h2>
    <p>Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and minimizing the impact of potential threats. It involves developing strategies to handle unexpected events that could cause harm or financial loss.</p>

    <h2>What is Insurance?</h2>
    <p>Insurance is a financial product that allows you to transfer risk to an insurance company in exchange for regular premium payments. In case of loss or damage, the insurer provides compensation according to the policy terms.</p>

    <h2>Relationship Between Insurance and Risk Management</h2>
    <p>Insurance is a tool used in the risk management process. After identifying and evaluating risks, insurance is often chosen as a way to transfer financial risk to a third party, reducing the burden on the insured person or entity.</p>

    <h2>Types of Risks</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Pure Risk:</strong> Involves only the possibility of loss (e.g., natural disasters, theft)</li>
      <li><strong>Speculative Risk:</strong> Involves gain or loss (e.g., investment risks)</li>
      <li><strong>Operational Risk:</strong> Arises from internal business failures</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Risk:</strong> Includes credit risk, liquidity risk, and market risk</li>
      <li><strong>Strategic Risk:</strong> Related to business decisions that affect long-term goals</li>
    </ul>
