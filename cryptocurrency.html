    <h2>What is Cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrency is a type of digital currency that operates on blockchain technology—a decentralized ledger system that records transactions across a network of computers. Unlike traditional currencies issued by governments, cryptocurrencies are maintained by a community of users and miners without central authority.
    </p>
    <p>
      The most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, but there are thousands of others including Ethereum, Solana, Binance Coin, and Cardano. These assets are known for their potential to increase in value and their role in shaping the future of decentralized finance (DeFi).
    </p>

    <h2>Why Invest in Cryptocurrency?</h2>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrency is often referred to as the "future of money." Investors are drawn to it for several reasons:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>High Return Potential:</strong> Some coins have experienced massive growth over short periods.</li>
      <li><strong>Diversification:</strong> Crypto offers an alternative to traditional assets like stocks or real estate.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation Hedge:</strong> Bitcoin is considered “digital gold” due to its capped supply.</li>
      <li><strong>Innovation:</strong> Blockchain enables decentralized apps, smart contracts, and new finance systems.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Does Cryptocurrency Work?</h2>
    <p>
      Cryptocurrencies are stored in digital wallets and recorded on a blockchain—a public and immutable ledger. Transactions are validated using consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (used by Bitcoin) or Proof of Stake (used by Ethereum 2.0).
    </p>
    <p>
      Each transaction is cryptographically secured, ensuring privacy, transparency, and resistance to fraud or manipulation.
    </p>

    <h2>Popular Cryptocurrencies</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bitcoin (BTC):</strong> The original and most valuable cryptocurrency, often used as a store of value.</li>
      <li><strong>Ethereum (ETH):</strong> Powers smart contracts and decentralized applications (dApps).</li>
      <li><strong>Binance Coin (BNB):</strong> Used for trading and transaction fees on Binance exchange.</li>
      <li><strong>Solana (SOL):</strong> High-speed blockchain for DeFi and NFTs.</li>
      <li><strong>Cardano (ADA):</strong> A research-based blockchain with energy-efficient transactions.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Getting Started with Cryptocurrency Investing</h2>

    <h3>Step 1: Research and Education</h3>
    <p>
      Before you invest in cryptocurrency, take time to learn how the market works, understand different types of coins, and analyze the use cases. Avoid hype-driven decisions—knowledge is your strongest asset in crypto investing.
    </p>

    <h3>Step 2: Choose a Reliable Exchange</h3>
    <p>
      A cryptocurrency exchange allows you to buy, sell, and store crypto. Popular exchanges include:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Binance</strong> – Global platform with hundreds of coins</li>
      <li><strong>Coinbase</strong> – User-friendly and trusted in the U.S.</li>
      <li><strong>Kraken</strong> – Secure with advanced trading tools</li>
      <li><strong>Yellow Card (Africa)</strong> – Easy fiat-to-crypto access for African users</li>
      <li><strong>Crypto.com</strong> – Offers both exchange and Visa card integration</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 3: Secure a Crypto Wallet</h3>
    <p>
      A wallet stores your private keys and allows you to control your crypto. There are two main types:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hot Wallets:</strong> Connected to the internet. Examples: Trust Wallet, MetaMask.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold Wallets:</strong> Offline storage for maximum security. Examples: Ledger, Trezor.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Step 4: Buy Your First Cryptocurrency</h3>
    <p>
      After funding your account with local currency (e.g., USD, KES), you can buy your desired coin. Start small, diversify your portfolio, and avoid investing money you can't afford to lose.
    </p>

    <h2>Investment Strategies in Crypto</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HODLing:</strong> Buying and holding a coin long-term despite market volatility.</li>
      <li><strong>Day Trading:</strong> Taking advantage of short-term price swings—very risky.</li>
      <li><strong>Staking:</strong> Earning passive income by locking coins to validate transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Dollar-Cost Averaging (DCA):</strong> Buying fixed amounts regularly to reduce impact of volatility.</li>
      <li><strong>Yield Farming:</strong> Lending crypto in DeFi protocols to earn interest and tokens.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Risks of Cryptocurrency Investing</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto is a high-risk, high-reward asset class. It’s vital to understand the risks involved:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Volatility:</strong> Prices can drop or rise by double digits in a single day.</li>
      <li><strong>Regulation:</strong> Government bans or regulations can impact prices.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Threats:</strong> Hacking, phishing scams, and rug pulls are common.</li>
      <li><strong>Lack of Insurance:</strong> Unlike banks, stolen or lost crypto is often unrecoverable.</li>
      <li><strong>Technical Barriers:</strong> Mistakes with wallets, private keys, or smart contracts can result in permanent loss.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Taxation of Crypto Profits</h2>
    <p>
      In most countries, crypto profits are subject to taxation. Capital gains tax applies when you sell crypto for profit, and income tax may apply to mining or staking rewards. Track all transactions and consult a tax advisor or use tools like Koinly or CoinTracker.
    </p>

    <h2>Crypto and the Future of Finance</h2>

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Remittances with lower fees</li>
      <li>Decentralized finance (DeFi) replacing banks</li>
      <li>NFTs for digital ownership</li>
      <li>Smart contracts for automation</li>
      <li>Tokenized real estate and stock assets</li>
    </ul>
