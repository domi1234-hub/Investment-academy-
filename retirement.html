    <h2>What is Retirement Planning?</h2>
    <p>
      Retirement planning is the process of determining your retirement income goals and the actions needed to achieve them. It involves identifying income sources, estimating expenses, setting a savings target, and managing assets and risk to ensure a secure and comfortable retirement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The earlier you start, the better prepared you’ll be to enjoy life after work. With proper planning, you can achieve financial independence, travel, pursue hobbies, and live without financial stress during your golden years.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Retirement Planning is Important</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Longevity:</strong> People are living longer, requiring more savings to last through retirement.</li>
      <li><strong>Inflation:</strong> The cost of living increases over time, reducing your purchasing power.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare:</strong> Medical expenses rise with age and can become a major cost.</li>
      <li><strong>Pension Gaps:</strong> Relying solely on a state pension or employer fund may not be enough.</li>
      <li><strong>Financial Freedom:</strong> Retirement planning lets you choose when and how to retire.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How Much Do You Need to Retire?</h2>
    <p>
      A common rule of thumb is the <strong>25x rule</strong>: Multiply your desired annual retirement income by 25. For example, if you need $40,000 per year, you should aim for $1,000,000 in savings.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alternatively, the <strong>4% rule</strong> suggests withdrawing 4% of your retirement savings annually to avoid outliving your money.
    </p>

    <h2>Stages of Retirement Planning</h2>
    <h3>1. Early Career (Ages 20–35)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Start saving as early as possible to benefit from compound interest.</li>
      <li>Focus on building an emergency fund and paying off high-interest debt.</li>
      <li>Contribute to employer-sponsored plans (e.g., 401(k), NSSF, etc.)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Mid-Career (Ages 36–50)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Increase contributions to retirement and investment accounts.</li>
      <li>Diversify your portfolio: stocks, bonds, real estate, mutual funds.</li>
      <li>Protect income with insurance and estate planning tools.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>3. Pre-Retirement (Ages 51–65)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Review and adjust your retirement target.</li>
      <li>Pay off major debts like your mortgage.</li>
      <li>Decide when to start withdrawing benefits (e.g., pensions or NSSF)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Retirement (65+)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Transition from wealth accumulation to income generation.</li>
      <li>Withdraw funds strategically to minimize taxes and ensure longevity.</li>
      <li>Consider downsizing, part-time work, or relocating to reduce costs.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Top Retirement Savings Options</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Employer Pension Schemes:</strong> Many companies offer retirement funds with employer matches.</li>
      <li><strong>Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs):</strong> Tax-advantaged accounts for retirement savings.</li>
      <li><strong>401(k) / 403(b):</strong> U.S.-based plans with tax-deferred growth and contribution limits.</li>
      <li><strong>NSSF (Kenya):</strong> A national retirement fund that allows voluntary top-ups.</li>
      <li><strong>Real Estate:</strong> Rental income and property appreciation offer long-term returns.</li>
      <li><strong>Mutual Funds & ETFs:</strong> Diversified investment vehicles for steady growth.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How to Build a Retirement Plan</h2>
    <h3>1. Calculate Your Retirement Needs</h3>
    <p>
      Estimate how much you’ll spend annually and for how many years. Consider:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Housing</li>
      <li>Food and utilities</li>
      <li>Healthcare and insurance</li>
      <li>Travel and hobbies</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>2. Assess Current Assets</h3>
    <p>
      Include savings, pensions, investments, home equity, and other assets. Subtract expected liabilities.
    </p>

    <h3>3. Choose the Right Investment Strategy</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Aggressive (Young age):</strong> More stocks and growth assets.</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate (Middle age):</strong> Balanced mix of growth and income.</li>
      <li><strong>Conservative (Near retirement):</strong> More stable assets like bonds and dividend stocks.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>4. Automate Savings</h3>
    <p>
      Set up automatic contributions to retirement accounts or investment plans to ensure consistency.
    </p>

    <h3>5. Monitor and Adjust</h3>
    <p>
      Review your plan annually. Adjust for inflation, income changes, or shifting goals.
    </p>
